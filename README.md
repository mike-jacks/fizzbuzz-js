Fizzbuzz JavaScript Assignment

Created Fizzbuzz in javascript. Beyond the assignment of printing to the console fizz, buzz, and fizzbuzz, I added an animated `li` element that renders to the screen. I even implemented a global variable for intervalId so when hitting either `FizzBuzz` or `Reset` buttons while rendering on screen, it will clear the interval and restart the render again. Prior to this addition, the screen would print in random order when subsequent button presses were made while still drawing to screen.
